"We wanted to let you know that youâ€™ve used 80% of your data plan for Git LFS on your personal account agniv-the-marker."

Uh oh,,,


git LFS now working.
git bisect also working.

ran into first personal issue of LFS. it took a while. it was probably faster then normal git but i still don't like how it took so long to push and pull on my machine. i dont believe this is a hardware issue, rather a lfs issue. also the history is not amazing for lfs on my machine for version history.
